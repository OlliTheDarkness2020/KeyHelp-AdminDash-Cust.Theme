Version:    0.9.3

Releases:   https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/releases

Homepage:   https://bulma.io/

Notes:      1) Replace the content of /assets/vendor/bulma/scss with the /sass/ directory from the Bulma archive.

            2) Since 0.8.0

                The control size increased to 2.5em.
                We do not want this and need to override it in various places to the prior settings
                We can not override it in our main scss files, due the calculated variables rely on a already defined other variable.

                Find the variable values of the following variables and update their value accordingly.
                (These are the values before 0.8.0)

                    $control-height: 2.25em !default
                    $control-padding-vertical: calc(0.375em - #{$control-border-width}) !default
                    $control-padding-horizontal: calc(0.625em - #{$control-border-width}) !default
                    $button-padding-vertical: calc(0.375em - #{$button-border-width}) !default
                    $button-padding-horizontal: 0.75em !default


            3) Since 0.9.0

                Bugfix for Safari

                    - There is a BUG in bulma / Safari, which cause the <th> element will not be able to inherit the text-align.
                    - There is a FIX for this behaviour in __scss/partials/_table.scss at the bottom. We may can remove it with the next update
                    - see: https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3076

            4) Since 0.9.3

                The colors have changed (It is not clear, if this was intentional or not)
                I like the colors of 0.9.2 more.
                /custom_variables/_custom_variables.scss takes care of setting the old colors.
