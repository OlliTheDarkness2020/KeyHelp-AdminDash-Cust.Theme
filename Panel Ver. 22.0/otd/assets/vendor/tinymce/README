Update:     1)      Download TinyMCE Community

            2)      Replace the full content of the folder

            3)      Download the language pack files from the URL above and put them into /langs/.
            3.1)    Rename language packs to match our language names in KeyHelp
                    Example:
                        "fr_FR" -> "fr",
                        "sv_SE" -> "sv",
                        "hu_HU" -> "hu",
            3.2)    If the language package is not available for download, use the one from the last KeyHelp release
            3.3)    Also rename within the files itself tinymce.addI18n('hu_HU' -> tinymce.addI18n('hu'
